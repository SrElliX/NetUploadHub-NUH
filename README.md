# Simple File Upload System for Network Sharing - HTML, CSS, PHP

This is a basic file upload system created for testing purposes. Feel free to use and modify it according to your needs.

## Purpose
While there are more sophisticated ways to share files across machines, this project simplifies the process of transferring files from other hosts on your local network to your main PC.

## Requirements
To run this application, you need to have XAMPP installed with an Apache server to host the codes.

## Project Structure
- **index.php**: Contains a simple form for file submission, allowing you to identify the machine that will receive the files.

- **styles.css**: Contains the main page styles for index.php.

## How to Use
1. Ensure you have XAMPP installed on your server machine.
2. Host the project files using the Apache server.
